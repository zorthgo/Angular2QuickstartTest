# Angular2 Component Router Test
Doing some testing with the new Component Router using Angular 2's Quickstart guide.



If you would like to run this locally follow the instructions below:

1 - Navigate to the folder where you would like to clone this repository to in a command prompt.

2 - Clone this repository by running the following command: git clone https://github.com/zorthgo/Angular2QuickstartTest.git

3 - Navigate to the SRC directory inside the cloned folder.

4 - Run the following command: npm run tsc

5 - In a new command prompt, navigate to the SRC folder again and run the following command: npm start

These two commands should compile all of the Typescript code and open a browser window with the test app running.
